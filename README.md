> [!IMPORTANT]\
> My name is Cory!, I usually script for roblox exploits whilst almost always keeping them **open source**. My roblox is [Profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/5388525718/profile). Recently I've quit the Luau langauge entirely as RBLX Exploiting is very close to dead. I'm investing my time in Java. I have a clear understanding of Java and would love to make Minecraft Clients. <br />
> My former name is **Coryu**, as I don't really go by that name as much anymore. I have a horrible history with the name <br />
> Also my contributions are very low in 2021 and 2022, just because I deleted alot of junk respoitories! <br />
> If you need to message me, my discord is always open to anyone! Strangely I am more active on Github than anything else <br />

> **My recent updates!** <br />
> I've posted my [Rotational Cursor](https://github.com/Not-Kyle/Universal-Scripts.lua/blob/main/Rotational%20Cursor.lua), I had just left it laying around randomly. <br />
> **Whats Next?** <br />
> Currently, I am making private script named ILLSEEYOUIN40, for MiscGunText:X in Roblox. I have a very overpowered godmode already. <br />
> **Focused Languages** <br />
> C++, Luau, Java <br />
> **Thank you all for contributing to my Github since 2021, Since I was 14 I've been determined to create scripts and I couldn't be more appreciative of your support! I couldn't of done it without all of you!** <br />

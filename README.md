> My name is Cory!, I usually script for roblox exploits whilst almost always keeping them **open source**. My roblox is [Profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/5388525718/profile). I only updated my old scripts whenever I feel like it, It's likely I'll never make a new script for Roblox. I'm investing my time in Java or C++. I have a clear understanding of Java and would love to make Minecraft Clients, but I would also love to make actual cheats or hacks using C++, soon after I learn C++, I might start C#.<br />
> My former name is **Coryu**, as I don't really go by that name as much anymore. I have a horrible history with the name <br />
> Also my contributions are very low in 2021 and 2022, just because I deleted alot of junk respoitories! <br />
> If you need to message me, my discord is always open to anyone! <br />

> **Thank you all for contributing to my Github since 2021, Since I was 14 I've been determined to create scripts and I couldn't be more appreciative of your support! I couldn't of done it without all of you!** <br />

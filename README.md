> [!IMPORTANT]\
> My name is Cory!, I usually script for roblox exploits whilst almost always keeping them **open source**. My roblox is [Profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/5388525718/profile) <br />
> My former name is **Coryu**, as I don't really go by that name as much anymore. I have a horrible history with the name <br />
> Also my contributions are very low in 2021 and 2022, just because I deleted alot of junk respoitories! <br />
> If you need to message me, my discord is always open to anyone! Strangely I am more active on Github than anything else <br />
